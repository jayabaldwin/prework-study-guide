# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for Bootcamp students going through their Prework. This guide contains notes on the basic principles of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

This project was designed to be used as a reference page for setting up HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, along with understanding the commands required to use Git locally and have a seamless Git flow. By having a condensed version of the prework content, students will be able to access essential information more efficiently once they commence their studies.

Through building this web application, I've learnt how to use various platforms and programs such as Git Hub, Terminal, VS Code, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
