        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organisation of a document written in HTML.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we MUST link the file using: rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css, between a link element in the head of the HTML. </li>
          <li>The selector defines which elements the rule will apply to e.g. p {declaration}, when refering to the properties of the text in a paragraph.</li>
          <li>The declaration contains the property we want to apply and the value of the property e.g. color: blue; </li>
          <li>A period preceding a property designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element.</li>
          <li>Anything written between /* and */ is a CSS comment and will be ignored by the browser</li>
        </ul>
