        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organisation of a document written in HTML.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>External style.css files are linked within the head of the HTML using: rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css, betweem a link tag. </li>
          <li>The selector defines which elements the rule will apply to e.g. p {declaration}, when refering to the properties of the text in a paragraph.</li>
          <li>The declaration contains the property we want to apply and the value of the property e.g. color: blue; </li>
          <li>A period preceding a property designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element.</li>
          <li>Anything written between /* and */ is a CSS comment and will be ignored by the browser</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) allows users to interact with websites using effects, interactivity, data communication etc.</li>
          <li>Connect script.js files with a [script] tag under the footer, within the body element.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code [var].</li>
          <li>A string is a sequence of text, the value is enclosed in quote marks. To access the string refer to the variable name.</li>
          <li>.log() will output whatever is inside the parentheses to the console using [console.log()]</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. </li>
          <li>Using conditional statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>[if] statements: provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate. If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets.  </li>
          <li>An array is a single variable used to hold a group of related data and can store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li>Indexing is used to work with individual data inside an array, following the variable name, beginning at [0].</li>
          <li>[for] loops contain 3 important statements. Starting point e.g. var x = 0; then the condition, x < the variable times the length of the array and the final statement x++ to express the pattern (x+1 indicates increasing indicies).</li>
          <li>for(x = 0; x < variable.length; x++) {// code block}]</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. It must be called by name in order to execute it [function name()].</li>
